name: Simple OpenMP Job
host: Kingspeak
script: omp-hello.sh
notes: >
        Hello OpenMP World prints the number of threads and the current thread id.
        This example uses 1 node with 16 cores on Kingspeak. Other CHPC nodes could use anywhere between 12 and 64 cores, depending on the cluster and the compute node where this job would run; the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable would also be set accordingly . A program must be written to take advantage of multithreading for this to work.
